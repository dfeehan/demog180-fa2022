Add Health is re-interviewing cohort members in a Wave V follow-up from 2016-2018 to collect social, environmental, behavioral, and biological data with which to track the emergence of chronic disease as the cohort moves through their fourth decade of life.\n",

The fourth wave of interviews expanded the collection of biological data in Add Health to understand the social, behavioral, and biological linkages in health trajectories as the Add Health cohort ages through adulthood, and the fifth wave of data collection continues this biological data expansion.\n",

It turns out that this is too hard a task to have a single solution: the best way to summarize or describe a network can depend a lot on what you are interested in understanding about the network. For example, one type of summary might tell you about what networks are at high or low risk of quickly spreading an infectious disease and a different type of network metric might tell you about how hierarchical or egalitarian relationships between network members are.\n",

On the other hand, if two metrics are totally unrelated to one another, then that might tell us that each one captures an independent aspect of network structure.\n",
